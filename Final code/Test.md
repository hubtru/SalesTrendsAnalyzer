# Test
This code reads in a CSV file containing sales data for different products and performs the following operations:
- It loads the data from the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame using the pd.read_csv() function.
- It pivots the DataFrame using the pivot() function to create a new DataFrame where each row represents a date, each column represents a product ID, and the values represent the quantity of products sold on that date for that product ID.
- It calculates the total sales quantity for each day by summing the values for each row and creates a new column called "total_quantity_day" to store these values.
- It loads another CSV file containing weather data and reads it into a new DataFrame using pd.read_csv().
- It suggests that new feature engineering steps could be performed to create additional features from the existing data to improve the performance of machine learning models, but there is no actual code provided for this step.
Overall, this code is useful for data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering of sales and weather data for use in machine learning modeling.
